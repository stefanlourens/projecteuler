/* @See http://projecteuler.net/problem=14 
 * 
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 *
 * n → n/2 (n is even) n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
 * sequence: 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
 *
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
 * contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
 * is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 *
 * NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
